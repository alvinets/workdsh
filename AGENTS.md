# DSH Desktop repository rules

This repository owns WorkDSH Web and Desktop. Desktop and Web consume the same exact official DSH published package version. Desktop binary dependencies and command-management helpers are extracted from checksum-locked official release installers.

## Git branch and release policy

- Keep exactly one long-lived product branch: the GitHub default branch, currently `main`. Do not maintain `main` and `master` as parallel product or release lines.
- Development and migration branches are temporary. Bring every accepted change back to the default branch through a reviewed pull request; verify required checks and that the intended commits are present there before treating the work as delivered.
- Create Desktop release tags and publish product artifacts only from commits reachable from the default branch. A successful build on a temporary branch is validation, not a release.
- After a temporary branch has been merged and its changes verified on the default branch, delete that temporary branch. Retain an unmerged branch only while its work is still under review; do not delete unique history.
- If the default branch is renamed, update GitHub settings, CI, website deployment, release triggers, and documentation together before removing the old branch.

## Prerequisites and setup

- Use Node.js `^22.19.0` or `>=24.0.0` and the root Yarn `4.18.0` release through Corepack.
- Install root dependencies with `corepack yarn install --immutable`.

## Build, run, and verify

- Start the desktop development workflow with `corepack yarn dev`.
- Build the desktop package with `corepack yarn build`.
- Run unit tests with `corepack yarn test`.
- Run type checking with `corepack yarn typecheck`.
- Run the complete headless gate with `corepack yarn check`.
- `apps/desktop/` is the only Desktop source and release workspace. Do not reintroduce a copied Beta package; optional release channels must build from this same source and pinned DSH version.
- The official release version locked in `upstream.json` is the single DSH version for the packaged WorkDSH Profile. Desktop source is an Electron carrier without direct DSH dependencies. A DSH upgrade is incomplete until `corepack yarn check:desktop-dsh-alignment`, the Desktop checks, and a packaged-runtime check pass. Default to the newest official stable DSH release after compatibility validation; use a pre-release only by explicit product decision. Do not tag a Desktop release while the version gate fails. The carrier must contain no second DSH installation.
- `apps/web/` owns Web launch, deployment and verification. Root `packages/` owns shared WorkDSH feature packages, and root `profiles/` owns composition. Its package manifests must declare the same exact DSH version as `upstream.json`; run `corepack yarn check:web-dsh-alignment` when either side changes. The Web workspace remains self-contained and does not import or modify the official source tree.

- `apps/desktop/` owns the Electron carrier, packaging, and release tests. DSH Host and Client code comes from the published official runtime Profile; WorkDSH features belong to the WorkDSH Profile packages.
- The Desktop workspace uses the root Yarn release with `nodeLinker: node-modules`. The nested `apps/web/` workspace retains its own pinned pnpm lockfile and package manager; run its commands from that directory. Do not install it into the root Yarn workspace.
- Keep presentation and WorkDSH feature changes in the Profile rather than adding a second Desktop Host or Client implementation.
- Keep graphical application launch explicit. Builds, typechecks, unit tests, and Loader smokes must remain headless-safe.

## Current authorized npm migration

- The user explicitly requires the latest published DSH release, currently `0.2.1-rc.2` (2026-10-17). Every actual DSH Host, Client and SDK npm package must use this same exact version. Web preview and Desktop preserve the complete native Conversation, using public Workspace/Layout APIs and only the narrowly authorized shared outer-frame patch below, without embedded custom conversation controls. Matching artifact hashes do not prove Desktop packaged-runtime acceptance; do not release Desktop until its runtime and UI checks pass.
- `upstream.json` separately locks each official binary archive's own version, URL, size and SHA-512. The explicitly locked macOS Intel archive remains the official `0.2.1-rc.1` archive solely for Node, pnpm, Python, Office assets and prebuilt command helpers, because no Intel `rc.2` archive is published. It must not supply DSH Host, Client or SDK packages. Preserve its original `runtime.json` and record the source accurately; do not relabel it as `rc.2` or implement an automatic fallback. Intel publication requires checks against its actual packaged x64 Resources, in addition to the common npm version gate.

## Personal and enterprise product boundary

- Personal Desktop, enterprise Desktop use one validated official DSH version and the same owned feature implementations. Preserve the complete official interface; never copy its settings, sidebar or right panel.
- Enterprise execution is Desktop-only: the official Host, Agent and tools run on the employee computer. Do not restore ECS member processes, a member gateway or remote session storage. Identity, storage, permissions and synchronization are explicit adaptations.
- There is one base Desktop installer. Enterprise account and collaboration plugins are installed explicitly, not shipped in the base runtime. Personal mode does not activate it. Projects are included in Desktop and Web. The server owns administration, authorization, collaboration data and model forwarding; collaboration activates only for authenticated enterprise members; personal mode must not activate it. Notifications and business applications remain optional external plugins.
- The administrator presets only the public backend origin in packaged `workdsh-config.json` via `WORKDSH_DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG`. Login credentials and model keys do not belong in this file.
- WorkDSH Admin owns accounts, organizations, authorization, audited member-visible conversation access and Spring AI internal model APIs. A deployment may preset only the model gateway *address* for the enterprise provider; the member types the internal Key and explicitly asks for the catalogue, so no provider, key or model list is injected or synchronized by product code. Personal providers can coexist. Do not restore enterprise model injection or background synchronization.
- Preserve user-facing README content and organize new material in the corresponding sections. Development logs, raw acceptance evidence, credentials and generated packages are not submission content.

- Never clone, import or compile official DSH source as part of product builds. `upstream.json` locks published package versions and Desktop archive URLs, sizes and SHA-512 hashes. Extract only runtime dependencies, Office assets and prebuilt command helpers; do not carry a second official Electron application or DSH installation.

- Explicit user-authorized exception (Web preview 2026-10-17; Desktop packaging and release 2026-10-18): the user's latest-version and compatibility-adaptation authorization extends this same two-seam exception to official `0.2.1-rc.2`; both may apply the exact-version/checksum-locked `native-workbench-frame-patch` to restore the rightmost complete native Conversation. Only the two outer-frame seams may change; preserve original headers, views, Composer and right-sidebar owners. Fail closed on unknown bytes, verify the packaged result and keep exact rollback. Desktop release still requires actual packaged-runtime and UI acceptance; no other official file changes are authorized.

## Delivery regression gate

- Directory migrations must update scripts, CI working directories, test globs and deployment contexts together. Source-only moves are incomplete.
- Required plugin delivery must pass composition, archive dependency closure, installed runtime and actual UI checks. Builds alone are not acceptance.
- Shared feature changes must trigger Desktop and Web CI. Enterprise plugin installation never grants membership; authorization and inactive personal mode remain mandatory.
- Candidate handover requires actual packaged Desktop and backend operation results. Report missing acceptance explicitly; never call a candidate complete while required plugins or entries are missing.
